# Data 23 Star Wars Project



## Project Plan

The goal of the project is to pull all the data on starships from the API using Python.
The data will be used to create a new collection in MongoDB of all starships with "pilot" key URL's being replaced with ObjectsID's from characters.
This will be done using Test Driven Development, functional programming and good coding principles.
A job board will be used to keep track of user stories.
