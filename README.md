# Data 23 Star Wars Project

## Overview

In this project, I will be using SWAPI (Star Wars API), https://swapi.dev/, to access data about star ships in Star Wars.\n
I will transform this data and insert it into a collection in MongoDB using Python.\n
Part of the transforming process is to link any embedded API URLs with matching information (specifically pilot info) from my characters collection in MongoDB.

## Methods

I will be using TDD throughout my project.\n
I will be using OOP in Python by creating classes to handle API get requests and to manage collections in MongoDB for example.\n
I will be using Trello to monitor my progress in the project.
